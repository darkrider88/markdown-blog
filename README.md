# Securely Dark Markdown Blog

Hi everyone, this is my markdown blog for posting writeups and some post about security.

## What it is?
This is inspired by Jykyll but not Jykyll!! I have created it to parse all the markdown files in a specific folder then index and display on the website.

## How it works?

It's easy!! you just have to create a markdown file, lets say test.md and place it in markdown folder.
The markdown file should contain its title, date, description and main image location in below format:

```
Title: Testing
Date: 1/3/2021
Descripton: you can put all these things in any sequence
Image: /assets/images/some.jpg 

Then here goes your content
```
After that place this file in markdown folder and relax.. everything will be handled by itself!
