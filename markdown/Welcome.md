Hey everyone, This is my Markdown blog inspired by Jykyll. Incase you do not know what Jykyll is..
Jykyll is a markdown files parser which list and shows your markdown file in html format. So whatever is written here is not in html.. but it is coming from a file.. isn't it amazing?

![oohh yeah](/assets/images/amazing.gif)

And you can add images too..
More over you can add headings code etc... for example

# Random javascript code

```js
function Welcome(){
	console.log('This is markdown magic');
}

```
